# Co-Issue Loan Boarding: Ideas & System Blueprint (v3)

> **Purpose:** Transform co-issue loan boarding bottlenecks (data/document quality + manual exceptions) into a
**high-FPY, low-latency, compliant pipeline**

Note: This is built for demo only

---

## 0) North-Star Outcomes

* **First-Pass Yield (FPY):** ‚â• 85% (no human touch)
* **Auto-clear rate of exceptions:** ‚â• 70% within 5 minutes
* **Time-to-Board (TTB):** ‚â§ 2 hours from package receipt
* **Defect Recurrence:** ‚àí60% within 90 days (feedback loop working)
* **Compliance clocks:** 100% on-time welcome letters / escrow setup
* **Analyst NPS:** measurable uplift post-deployment

_Addition: Tie Analyst NPS directly to reduced exception churn. Add baseline FPY/TTB numbers for stronger demo storytelling._

---

## System at a Glance (Capability Map)

### 1. Profiles & Agencies

* **Seller Profile** ‚Äî seller (Correspondent) profile registration, login, seller view
* **Buyer Profile** ‚Äî buyer (Aggregator) profile registration, login, buyer view - for eg: Freedom Mortgage
* **Agencies** ‚Äî Agency profile (Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie).

### 2.1 Stage

Ability to stage sample - Commitment, purchase advice, loan data (ULDD), documents for manually upload

### 2.2 Generate Synthetic Data

Ability to generate synthetic data from sample - Commitment, purchase advice, loan data (ULDD)
link the 3 datasets with a investor loan number
stage the generated data for downstream reuse
link the documents uploaded with the stage dataset.

Clarify which fields are randomized vs. deterministic fixtures to ensure repeatable demo runs

### 3.1 Scheduler

Ability to schedule - Commitment, purchase advice, loan data (ULDD) , documents download - from sample / synthetically generated dataset from stage

### 3.2 Pipelines

**Commitment Pipeline** ‚Äî ability to download commitments via Agency API (synthetic dataset from stage)
**Purchase Advice Pipeline** ‚Äî ability to download purchase advice via Agency API (synthetic dataset from stage)
**Loan Data Pipeline** ‚Äî ability to download loan data via Agency API (synthetic dataset from stage)
** Documents Pipeline** - ability to download documents via Agency API (stage location)
**Loan Tracking Pipeline** ‚Äî link and track commitment, purchase advice, loan data, documents

  * **Validations** ‚Äî automated compliance and data checks.
  * **Exceptions** ‚Äî error/mismatch routing to orchestrator.

Frame pipelines as pluggable adapters per agency. 
Emphasize fingerprint & reconcile for duplicate versions._

### 3.3 Loan Data Tracking

* **Track Loan Data** ‚Äî
* **Track Commitments** ‚Äî
* **Track Purchase Advice** ‚Äî
* **Track Documents** ‚Äî split, classify, index, version, and reconcile required docs.

### 3.4 Documents per Loan

* **Intelignt Document Processing** ‚Äî ability to process pdf blob
  * **OCR** ‚Äî  LLM to split, classify, index and extrcat data --> digitize and fingerprint.
  * **Data Extraction** ‚Äî structured capture of required fields.
  * **Version Control** ‚Äî idenfiy duplicate documents .

---

## 4) Agentic Operating Model

* **PlannerAgent** ‚Äî builds task graph ‚ÄúBoard this package‚Äù under hard constraints.
* **ToolAgent** ‚Äî executes whitelisted tools with strict JSON I/O.
* **VerifierAgent** ‚Äî runs validation rule packs, blocks on violations, drives rollback.
* **MLAssistStub** ‚Äî fixture-backed suggestions; no state commits.

**Collaboration Pattern**: Task Graph (DAG), not chat.
`CommitmentsReceived, PurchaseAdviceReceived, LoanDataReceived, DocumentPackageReceived ‚Üí DocsIndexed ‚Üí RulesEvaluated ‚Üí AutoFixApplied ‚Üí ExceptionsRaised ‚Üí EscrowReady ‚Üí BoardingStaged ‚Üí Boarded ‚Üí LettersQueued`

 
* Add **confidence thresholds + override workflows** for auto-fixers.  
* Introduce **human-in-the-loop checkpoints** for high-risk exceptions (rate/APR mismatches, escrow defects).  

Define rollback protocols (what‚Äôs reverted/logged). 
Add priority handling (e.g., FHA/VA loans). 
Consider Exception UX stub as sidecar agent.

---

## 5) Data & Document Quality

* **Canonical schema** ‚Äî MISMO-aligned with provenance + confidence tagging.
* **Validation Packs** (demo-ready):

  * ULDD/UCD parity (rate, amount, MI coverage).
  * Escrow integrity (hazard/flood, due dates, cushions).
  * MERS/Assignment (MIN format, registration, assignment chain).
* **Authoritative Source Rules**:

  * Note > ULDD for rate.
  * Final CD > UCD for cash-to-close.
  * Title > ULDD for legal description.

* Add **Knowledge Graph Layer** on top of canonical schema:  
  - Link loans, docs, and counterparties for cross-loan reconciliation.  
  - Enable clustering of recurring defects to support **root-cause analysis**.  

* Add confidence score surface per extracted field to support overrides._

---

## 6) Auto-Resolution & Exceptions

* **Auto-Fixer Bots** ‚Äî format normalizer, SSN formatter, date harmonizer, FIPS normalizer.
* **Exception Orchestrator** ‚Äî taxonomy, SLA timers, routing, bulk ops.
* **Playbook-in-Workflow** ‚Äî one-click guided resolution; structured logs for automation backlog.


* **Exception Analyst Workbench (UX stub)**:  
  - Guided resolution screens (taxonomy-driven).  
  - One-click ‚Äúaccept fix / reject fix‚Äù with structured logs.  
  - SLA timers and confidence indicators surfaced in analyst view.  

* Enumerate initial auto-fixer set. Add batch-level triage actions. Track acceptance vs. override rates._

---

## 7) Shift-Left with Counterparties

* **Pre-Flight Portal/API** ‚Äî run boarding rules pre-ship.
* **Machine-readable defect feedback** for correspondents.
* **Counterparty Scorecards** ‚Äî YAML/CSV fixtures for analytics + incentive plans.


* **Real-Time Feedback Dashboards** for correspondents:  
  - Push notifications on exception patterns.  
  - Defect recurrence heatmaps.  
  - Immediate alerting when rule packs fail pre-flight.  

* Add gamification hooks (leaderboards). Show cost-of-defect impact. Risk: sellers need incentives for adoption._

---

## 8) Boarding & Compliance

* **Escrow Setup Service** ‚Äî recompute impounds, validate FIPS/county, MSP/Sagent payloads.
* **Boarding Orchestration** ‚Äî staging, commit, rollback.
* **Compliance Ledger** ‚Äî timers for RESPA/TILA; immutable WORM log.


* Define **negative path scenarios**:  
  - SLA breach handling (e.g., TTB > 2 hrs).  
  - Compliance clock miss (e.g., welcome letter delay).  
  - Regulator escalation workflow.  

* Add retry lane for SLA breaches. Ledger should be queryable by regulator role in demo._

---

## 9) Observability & Metrics

* **Command Center** ‚Äî dashboards for FPY, TTB, exception clearance, recurrence, NPS.
* **Agent/tool-level metrics** ‚Äî evidence drill-through.
* **Synthetic KPIs** from generated datasets.


* Add **counterparty scorecard drill-downs** (loan-level, defect-level).  
* Extend **command center** with:  
  - Recurrence clustering from knowledge graph.  
  - Auto-fixer acceptance/rejection metrics.  

* Add run IDs for deterministic traceability. Add analyst productivity metric (exceptions/day)._

---

## 10) Security & Governance

* **PII masking/tokenization** for ACH/SSN.
* **Dual-control** for final commits.
* **Versioned schema governance** ‚Äî correspondent contracts validated in CI.
* **Audit packs** exportable for regulators.

*  Add RBAC to Command Center (Seller vs. Buyer vs Analyst views). PII masking should be supported

---

## 9) Roll-In Plan

2. **Auto-Fixer v1** ‚Äî enable deterministic fixes + MSP staging.
3. **Escrow + Docs** ‚Äî escrow recompute + versioning; auto-chasing.
4. **Pre-Flight** ‚Äî portal/API fixtures + scorecards.
5. **Expand Fixers + ML Stub** ‚Äî raise auto-clear %, retire low-value queues.

Add Synthetic dataset & pipelines. Tie each phase to KPI improvements (FPY‚Üë, TTB‚Üì, recurrence‚Üì)._

---

## 10) What to Measure

* FPY ‚Üë
* TTB ‚Üì
* Auto-clear % ‚Üë
* Recurrence ‚Üì
* Analyst NPS ‚Üë
* Manual touches/loan ‚Üì
* 100% on-time compliance events

Add auto-fix adoption curve and counterparty engagement (% pre-flight usage)._

---

## 11) ML Maturity Path *(new)*

* **Phase 1:** MLAssistStub (fixture-backed).  
* **Phase 2:** Supervised ML on historical exceptions.  
* **Phase 3:** Reinforcement from analyst override logs.  
* **Phase 4:** Semi-autonomous ‚Äúauto-clear with confidence banding.‚Äù  

Add synthetic exception dataset for Phase 2 training. 
Ensure override logs are structured/labeled for Phase 3. Tie Phase 4 into VerifierAgent gate._

## üîß Gaps / Risks (Inline Notes)

1. Analyst UX stub must be visible in demo.  
3. Counterparty adoption depends on incentives.  
4. Compliance escalations need explicit regulator view.  
5. Synthetic data must include edge cases (missing docs, escrow errors, SSN mismatches).
